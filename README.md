Kickstarter Analysis
Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Louise had a fundraiser for her play that ended up doing well and came close to its goal in a short amount of time. She was interested in how other campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. I used this data set to gather some conclusions. Over the course of analyzing the data presented I gathered two conclusions that stood out most. One conclusion was that I noticed the month of May was the most successful month in comparison to other months regarding launch dates. The other conclusion I was able to draw was that although there are significantly less failed fundraisers compared to successful, they do follow a very similar pattern throughout the year. When success rate is up so is failed rate. In December, failed and successful were at the same amount. 
Outcomes of Goals
The outcomes based on goals was quite different throughout the analysis. There seems to be quite a difference in the amount of successful and amount of failed. There are times when the data meets and is the same for periods of time and there are periods of time when the data is opposite. The percentage of successful goals starts at a peak and then dips over time. The percentage of failed started low and then increased over time. Overall, there is more failure than success. 
Limitations in the Data Set
I did not notice any limitations within the data set.
